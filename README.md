I have hosted this web application in Heroku but the uploaded pdf files canâ€™t be opened since I have used Cloudinary free cloud service for media storage and it has a restriction of opening files others than images. However, the github repository has the all functional features including opening files. The website at above url works completely fine except the opening of files.
